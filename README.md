# my-portfolio-page

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This page is my first React application built up from scratch. I thought it would be nice to combine my first project and my portfolio into one.

## General Information

During the building process, I have learned a lot about hooks, states, conditional rendering, and some other minor things related to this project.

The purpose of this project is to give a hint about my plans, my style, and my ambitions and to help me get my first job as a junior front-end developer.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* React

## Project Status

I decided that the project is finished, but there is definitely room for improvement, I plan to build exactly this page in Angular, in order to learn.
